# Introduction

## What is EasyFarm?

EasyFarm is a general purpose farming program for Final Fantasy XI. The program allows the user to customize various aspects for spells and abilities, allowing the user to accomplish tasks without the program being specifically designed for the task on hand.

## Origin

EasyFarm was originally developed for personal use, purely for farming items like beehive chips, which were used in crafting. Upon hearing a request on the FFEVO forums in 2012, the EasyFarm code was released on BitBucket, free to the public. This made the program one of the only free, available to use farmbot for Final Fantasy XI. 

The core design of the program reflects this history, aiming to be as general purpose as possible, to reduce the maintainability that is required to keep this program working for years to come.

## Features

EasyFarm supports the following features: 

* Customizable Actions
* Mob Targeting
* Aggro Detection
* Self Healing
* Persistent Settings
* Player Auto-Follow
* Trust Support

With these features, users can perform the following tasks: 

1. Farming mobs
2. Level characters. 
3. Skill up physical and magical skills. 

## Important

EasyFarm was not designed to be left farming unattended for long periods of time. Please be kind of other players and the game economy when using this program. 

## How To Remain Stationary - Pull Stationary

Engaging with ranged attacks or melee attacks removes the no approach rule. So if you pull with a JA or spell you'll stand still until it closes in on you.

 It runs to the mob because it want to use a spell or JA which have close range set up in settings.

 If you want to prevent it, just set the Distance slider all the way to the right under the Action tab for each skill/spell you have in you     profile.

 If you want to avoid running into mobs pull it with range attack/spell with Approach ticked off and like I mentioned above, right JA/Spell setup in Battle branch.

 This of course assumes you have the rest of your settings correct. 
 
 Set provoke pull at 20 or whatever
 Set your route to one coordinate
 Wander to 0 
 Detection to 20-21, Engaged checked with approach unchecked and then turn it on.
 I will say i've had bad luck with this because there is a problem that involves the bot thinking it isn't engaged when it is, but that's another can of worms.
